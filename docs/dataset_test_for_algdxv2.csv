# In 'dxster/docs/ealgdx_algorithm_table.csv' there are 294 unique sets of
# parameters, based on CDR sum of boxes and NACC UDS 3.0 inputs, that will give
# a Algorithmic Consensus Alzheimer's Diagnosis. This is the new basis of the
# AlgDx v2. The objective is to use more Quantitative Data as inputs to the
# ALgDx. These changes have been made in consult with teams from UF, FIU, UM and
# Mt Sinai who worked to develop AlgDx v1. The following data set is
# intended to mimic the formatting of a dataset extract that a person may
# receive from a NACC data request. It will hopefully contain enough records
# that will test the validity of the 294 'cases' for the new version, AlgDx v2,
# of the ALgDx algorithm. This data set is intended to provide reference data to
# unit tests to test each AlgDx v2 test case.
